<h1>Authenticating Login System</h1>
<p>This is a command-line program that simulates a login system. The user is prompted to enter a password, and access is only granted if the password entered matches the predetermined password in the program. If the user enters the wrong password, the program displays an error message and asks the user to try again. After three failed attempts, the program displays a message indicating that the user may be attempting unauthorized access and terminates.</p>
